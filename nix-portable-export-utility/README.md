# Nix Portable Export Utility

## About


Nix portable export utility is a very simple bash script program that creates shortcuts to run commands through nix-shell

This program is for [Nix Portable](https://github.com/DavHau/nix-portable) and [Nix Installers](https://github.com/krishnakumarg1984/nix-portable-utils/tree/main/installers)

This project depends on [Nix Portable](https://github.com/DavHau/nix-portable) installed with [Nix Installers](https://github.com/krishnakumarg1984/nix-portable-utils/tree/main/installers). If you don't use the installers, it won't work.

To use it you type `nix-export` command location-of-shortcut

An example would be

```bash
nix-export ~/.nix-portable/bin/neofetch ~/.local/bin/neofetch
```

this is what the contents in the newly created shortcut would be. It is located at ~/.local/bin

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nix-shell -p --run /home/username/.nix-profile/bin/neofetch
```
